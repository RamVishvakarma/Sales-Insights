<h1>Sales Insights : Data Analysis and Visualization Using SQL and Power BI</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project focuses on using SQL and Power BI to perform data analysis, data cleaning, and dashboard creation.<br>
The initial phase involves analyzing a MySQL database containing sales insights, including customer, transaction, product, and market data.<br>
The project progresses to the integration of Power BI for advanced data transformation and visualization, highlighting the importance of data preparation and modeling.<br>
<br>
<h3>Power BI Integration and Data Transformation</h3>
<br>
The project transitions to connecting Power BI with the MySQL database to perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes.
<br>
Participants learn to clean and transform data in Power BI, focusing on preparing it for visualization and analysis.
<br>
<h3>Key Highlights</h3>
<br>
<h4>Data Transformation: Demonstrates the ETL process, converting messy data into a usable format.
<br>
Data Modeling: Introduces creating data models and establishing relationships between tables using a star schema.
<br>
Data Cleaning: Includes filtering out negative sales and irrelevant entries.
<br>
Currency Conversion: Converts sales amounts from USD to INR for consistency.
<br>
Power Query Utility: A powerful tool within Power BI for filtering, cleaning, and reshaping data.
<br>
Data Relationships: Establishing relationships using a star schema enhances analytical efficiency.
<br>
Data Quality: Removing erroneous entries ensures reliable analysis.
<br>
Currency Standardization: Avoids calculation errors and maintains consistency.</h4>
<br>
<h3>Advanced Data Cleaning and Dashboard Creation</h3>
<br>
Building upon previous lessons, this phase emphasizes handling real-world data issues such as duplicate transactions and currency inconsistencies. The project culminates in the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard.
<br>
<h3>Key Highlights</h3>
<br>
<h4>Data Cleaning: Focuses on resolving duplicates and filtering out anomalies.
<br>
Dashboard Construction: Now creating a detailed dashboard with visualizations.
<br>
Interactive Visualizations: Enables dynamic filtering by customer, region, or date.
<br>
Revenue Analysis: Tracks performance by customers and regions, illustrating trends over time.
<br>
Measures in Power BI: Defines metrics for revenue and sales quantity to drive decision-making.
<br>
KPIâ€™s: Revenue, Product sales, Revenue By Customer, Revenue By Product Types, Revenue by Year
<br>
Visualizations: Crads, clustered bar chart, Line chart, Slicers.
<br>
Customizing Visuals: Enhances dashboard aesthetics for better user engagement.</h4>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<br>
This project provides a comprehensive approach to data analysis and visualization, starting with SQL-based querying and progressing to advanced Power BI features. 
By focusing on data preparation, transformation, and modeling, participants gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques essential for data analysts.The resulting dashboards enable actionable insights, laying a solid foundation for future projects.
